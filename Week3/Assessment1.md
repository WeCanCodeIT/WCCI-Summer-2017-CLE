## Assessment #1 (60 minutes)
Complete the following coding problems. The order in which you choose to solve them is completely up to you. They are not listed in any order of easiest to hardest, shortest to longest, or by skills needed. Be sure to Run Tests on your code to ensure your solution will pass. Once your solution can pass all test cases, make sure you SUBMIT your solution. Running test cases is NOT submitting. Your solutions must be submitted in order to get credit.

You are allowed to use your own notes, Google, and your book(s). 

You may NOT discuss the problems or give and/or get help from anyone in the class, past classes, or outside of We Can Code IT. You are not permitted to have Slack open during the exam. StackOverflow is permitted.
