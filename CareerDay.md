# Career Day Project Presentations
Each team will have an assigned instructor to facilitate the project presentations process with employers at Career Day. Each team should prepare a presentation that follows the following outline. Keep in mind that the presentation will be capped at a maximum time of 20 minutes.

### Part 1: Project Overview & Introduction (Max: 3 Minutes)
- Introduce team members
- Name of the application
- Who is the audience for the application?
- What problem does the application solve (feel free to include a statistic)?
- What are users able to do with the application (use your user stories as a guide)?
- What does the user experience as a result of using the app?

### Part 2: Application Walkthrough Video (Max: 6 Minutes)
- This video should be prerecorded using [Flashback Express](https://www.flashbackrecorder.com/express/) and should be a walkthrough of how to use the app.

### Part 3: Strictly Technical (Max: 6 Minutes)
- Decide on 2-3 technical aspects of the application to discuss with employers.
- Use this as an opportunity to highlight the technical depth of the project and some of your most difficult problems to solve.
- Remember, some career day attendees are business people and others are developers, so be prepared to sandwich your explanations as such:
  - High level overview of what the technical problem is that the team solved
  - The solution you all came up with as a high level overview
  - How you implemented the solution - get technical and use correct terminology!
  
### Part 4: Q & A (Min: 5 Minutes)
- Start this section by noting a couple of your "What's next in development" items from your product backlog. This could be items you did not get to as well as nice to haves.
- Be prepared for employers to ask you specific questions about your development process, such as SCRUM and problem solving.
- Know your code! Each person should be able to answer questions about the project, but also know your strengths and play to them.
- Make sure your code is cleaned up in case employers want to take a look.
