# DateTime Play Time
DateTime Play Time includes mini Problems to Explore the DateTime Class. For each of these mini problems, you should be using the DateTime class and its properties and methods to solve the problem.

### Problem 1: Today, Tomorrow, & Yesterday
Using the DateTime class, print to the console, the following lines:
```
Today is Wednesday.
Yesterday was Tuesday.
Tomorrow is Thursday.
```
_This example output is based on the current day the program is run being a Wednesday. `Today` should be whichever day it is when the program is run._

### Problem 2: Birthday Day in the Year
Create a DateTime instance for your birth date in 2017. Print the following to the console:
```
My birthday is the 283 day of the year.
```
_This example output is based on a birthday of October 10, 2017._

### Problem 3: Number of Days
Using DateTime, write a program that prints the number of days of a given month and year.
```
In 2017, February has 28 days.
```
_Hint: Use `DaysInMonth()`_
