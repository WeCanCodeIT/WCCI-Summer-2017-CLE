# How Many Holes?
For this problem, you will be given a text file called `Numbers.txt` which will serve as the input. Based on the number given, your program will need to output how many holes are in the number.

### Sample Inputs & Outputs
Inputs:
1.  `1234`
2.  `56890`
3.  `47`

Outputs:
1.  `1`
2.  `5`
3.  `1`

Your program should print the correct output to the console.

### Getting Started
Clone the [HowManyHoles](https://github.com/WeCanCodeIT/HowManyHoles) repository. You will be creating your program as a console application using the cloned project. The text file, called `Numbers.txt`, with the input is already included in the solution. You should output your calculations as a record to the console window.
