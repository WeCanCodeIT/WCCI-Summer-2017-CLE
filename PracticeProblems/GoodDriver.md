# Good Driver
You work for a car insurance company that is running a special deal for good drivers. In order for a customer to be given "Good Driver" status, the driver must install a Good Driver Device in their car that will track their driving. Your job is to develop the software that will run calculations based on their trips and output a report.

## Good Driver Input
The Good Driver Device reports driving data in a text file called `DrivingRecord.txt`. 

## Getting Started
Clone the Good Driver repository. You will be creating your program as a console application using the cloned project. The text file with the driving record information is already included in the solution. You will need to use [StreamReader](https://www.dotnetperls.com/streamreader) to read the information from the file. You should output your calculations as a record to the console window.
