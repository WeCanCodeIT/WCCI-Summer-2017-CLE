## Overview

Create a webpage that acts like a magic 8-ball.

## Tasks

### Required Tasks

- [ ] Set Up
- [ ] A project that contains an index.html file and a js file and/or css file
- [ ] 8-ball page

- [ ] The phrase should be chosen randomly from a JavaScript array of phrases 

Hint: If you see any JavaScript array documentation that mentions using the new keyword, AVOID!

### Stretch Tasks

- [ ] Dramatic pause before showing phrase
- [ ] Animate the 8-ball shaking/phrase appearing
- [ ] Make the phrase disappear automatically after 5 seconds
- [ ] Use CSS to make the app look way cooler

### Details

- Create a magic 8-ball webpage, powered by JavaScript and/or jQuery.
- The page should consist of a place where a phrase will appear, and a shake button that will cause a phrase to appear.

### Stretch Tasks
The required tasks of this assignment will lead to a very bare-bones 8-ball. You can use CSS and more JavaScript and jQuery to make this pretty cool, though.

### Hints

- Use IDs to signify special elements in your html. If you're using JavaScript use document.getElementById to target that element, then you can change the contents with the innerHTML property.  If you're using JQuery you can use JQuery selectors and the .html() fucntion.

- Play around in the console to investigate the properties of elements that are modifiable.
