## Overview
Given some mockups from a designer create a close approximation of a website. Utilize HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to replicate the responsive site.

## Skills Required
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

## Tasks
- [ ] Elements
  - [ ] Navbar
  - [ ] Header or Jumbotron
  - [ ] Locations
  - [ ] Ammenities
  - [ ] Carousel (Reviews)
  - [ ] Form (Contact)
  - [ ] Footer
- [ ] Bootstrap grid
- [ ] Is the site responsive?
  - [ ] Use existing bootstrap classes to develop the mobile version first
  - [ ] Address `xs`, `sm`, `md`, and `lg` sizes (Elements must collapse and expand correctly for all screen sizes)
- [ ] Include photos appropriately
- [ ] Google Font
- [ ] Closely approximate the mockup
- [ ] You are required to create a branch for each of the elements listed under Elements (above) and once the element is complete, merge the branch into your Master branch.


## Details
You are working as a front-end developer at a marketing agency. The design team has created a new layout for a client's web site. Their previous website was done several years back, and was not responsive. Not only do they want an attractive site featuring homes, but they want to ensure it is usable on all screen sizes.

Below, find the mockup from the design team. They have given us a good amount to work with.

To get the colors right, either choose an online color picker, or download a program (like Gimp) that allows you to choose colors from a picture and tells you their hex values.

The designers didn't specify fonts for us, but want us to get as close as we can to their design images. They want to use free fonts, so you thought you could help the team save money by using Google Fonts.

You are pretty sure these can be included on web pages pretty easily. Also, they are open source / free to use, plus since many sites use Google fonts, some users may already have these cached on their computers, making the page ultimately faster to load than if using a completely custom font.

## Stretch Tasks
Once you've got the basic layout implemented and responsive, it's time to add some pizzazz. Experiment using different CSS techniques to accentuate boxes when the mouse is over them, and/or look into using transitions to make them smoothly animated!

- [ ] Explore using `:hover` and CSS transitions to make the site more dynamic
- [ ] After you have finished the homepage you can try expanding your design and creating other pages linked from the homepage
- [ ] Experiment using additional Bootstrap components that we haven't explored in class

## Hints
Work Priority: Structure, Responsive, Styling!!

Start with the **structure**. Before getting too caught up in getting everything pixel perfect, look at how the layout is going to fit into Bootstrap's grid system, and determine what class(es) you need to use to get it there for the different screen sizes. Finally, create your own custon CSS to try to match the styling of the mockup.

Use [semantic elements](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) where appropriate

Check out the [Bootstrap components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) list for ideas of things to simply drop into your HTML, along with the [Bootstrap CSS](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) for some more examples of how to use the grid system.

Remember to use the bootstrap class ```img-responsive``` on your ```<img/>``` elements if you would like them to be responsive.
