- Mini FizzBuzz Problem (Final Jeopardy Problem)
  - Ask the user for 2 numbers. One number will be the FIZZ number and one number will be the BUZZ number. 
  - When you run the program, a user should be able to enter a test number.
  - If the test number is a multiple of the FIZZ number, print "Fizz!".
  - If the test number is a multiple of the BUZZ number, print "Buzz!".
  - If the test number is a multiple of the FIZZ and BUZZ numbers, print "FizzBuzz!".
  - If the test number is NOT a multiple of the FIZZ or BUZZ numbers, print the test number.
