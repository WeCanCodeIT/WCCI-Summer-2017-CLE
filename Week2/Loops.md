## Topics
## Goals
- Examine loop programming constructs.
- Implement conditional repetitions (while and do-while loops).
- Work with for-loops. 
- Explore different loop definitions and constructions.
- Understand some key usages of loops.
- Learn about foreach-loops.
- Understand how to use multiple loops placed inside each other (nested loops).
#### Loops
 - What is a loop?
 - When would you use a loop?
 - Why would you use a loop?
 - Nested Loops
 - Infinite Loops
 - Keywords: `break` & `continue`
 #### For Loop
 - When to use a for loop
   - Counting
   - Iterating through a collection
 - Syntax
 - Parts of a for loop
   - keyword: `for`
   - initializer
   - condition
   - updater
#### Foreach Loop
 - When to use a foreach loop
   - Iterating through a collection
 - Syntax
 - Parts of a foreach loop
   - Keywords: `in`, `foreach`
#### Do While Loop
 - When to use a do while loop
   - Want a chunk of code to run once regardless, but then run multiple times after if a condition is met
 - Syntax
 - Parts of a do while
   - keywords: `do`, `while`
#### While Loop
 - When to use a while loop
   - Want a chunk of code to run only if a condition is met first
 - Syntax
 - Parts of a while loop
   - keyword: `while`
   
## Practice
### Do It
- Create an array called days with the elements Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Using a For Loop, print the elements of the days array.
- Start with the string "Once upon a time" and create an array called storyWords using the Split method. Reverse the order of the elements in the array and using a For Loop, print each word.
### Do It
- Write a program that takes your favorite foods and prints them out one at a time. (Use a foreach loop.)
- Create an array of lucky numbers(just any numbers you like). Using a foreach loop, print the following:
  - If the array holds the numbers 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, then the printed result should say
```
  Your Lucky Number is: 3
  Your Lucky Number is: 5
  Your Lucky Number is: 7
  Your Lucky Number is: 11
  Your Lucky Number is: 15
```

### Do It
- Ask the user if he/she/they would like to check the patient in for his/her/their appointment
- Using a While Loop, run the following sequence only if the user's answer is not YES
- Print "PATIENT CHECK IN SYSTEM"
- Ask the user for the client's full name
- Ask the user for the client's 6-digit patient ID
- Ask the user for the client's appointment time (i.e. 2:00 PM)
- Ask the user if he/she/they would like to check the patient in for his/her/their appointment

### Do It
- Ask the user for the class they would like to add to their GPA calculation
- Ask the user for the letter grade for the class (no + or - grades)
- Ask the user if they have another class they would like to add to their GPA calculation
- Using a Do While Loop, repeat the code if the user says "YES"

### Do It
 - Write a program that prints a multiplication table (5 x 5, for example) using a nested loops.
 - Create an array of your favorite movies. Print out each movie in the list, unless the move starts with a vowel. Hint : Research .startsWith()
 - Write a console application that asks the user for an integer. If that integer is evenly divisible by 3, then write “You Won!” If it isn’t, write “You Lost.” Keep asking them for a number (looping) until they win.
